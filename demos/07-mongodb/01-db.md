# Database
- Data is at the heart of any application
- A place to store, modify and retrieve data

## Why not store in a simple file
- not be "structured"
- not be easy to retrieve, manipulate (work with it)
- easy to lose data (what if file gets corrupted)

- DB is a specialist at storing data

- RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management Systems)
    - Examples: MySQL, Oracle, PostGreSQL, Microsoft SQL, SSML, Microsoft Access
    - Querying language
        - SQL - Structured Query Language
        - Normalization
    - The data gets split across multiple tables
        - For example - Orders - gets spread across multiple tables - shipping, billing, order details
            - DBMS has to consult multiple tables when a "query" is made, to get the data
            - slows down the speed of DBMS

- NoSQL DBs
    - Data is not stored in tables
    - If not tables, then how to store data?
        - Documents - Store related information together
            - Example: Order information like shipping, billing, order details will likely be in fewer places than RDBMS
            - Semi-structured
                - Example: Most information is same for all orders in the app. But some may be specific to an order (for eg. discount coupon code needs to be available only for orders placed with a valid coupon code)
        - Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB
        - Graph DB
            - Example: Useful for social media sites
            - Neo4j
        - Key-value pair storages
            - Useful for caching search results
            - Memcache
        - And other kinds of DBs...
            

## Database
- 1 MongoDB server can have many Databases
    - Database: A collection of data for an application
- 1 database can have many collections
    - Example for an online store can have these collections
        - Users
        - Products
        - Orders
- 1 collection will have many documents
    - Users
        - Rahul (document 1)
        - Ramesh (document 2)
        - ...
